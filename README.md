# Autonomous-IR-Guided-Competitive-Cart-with-Obstacle-Avoidance
Autonomous cart using IR signals for navigation and can avoid obstacles

This project involves designing and implementing a competitive autonomous cart.
The cart navigates by detecting an Infrared (IR) signal modulated at a specific frequency, transmitted from the other end of the room.
Equipped with IR receivers, the cart continuously processes the signal to determine its direction and moves towards the transmitter.
The system also includes obstacle avoidance sensors to detect and navigate around obstacles.
The propulsion system, powered by four DC motors, ensures the cart moves efficiently.
The control unit integrates data from all sensors, guiding the cart to reach the transmitter in the shortest time, aiming to outperform competing carts.
Comprehensive testing and optimization of each assembly—signal transmission, reception, propulsion, and obstacle avoidance—were conducted to ensure reliability and performance.
